I would like to thank my supervisors, \emph{Stefan Radicke} and \emph{Patrick Bader}, for their support and patience as well as the good advice and short email response times.

I would also like to thank \emph{Christopher Manthei} and \emph{Hannes Pernpeintner} for the discussions we had and the insight into graphics programming you shared.
