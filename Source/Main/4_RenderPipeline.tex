    High level goals of this chapter:

    -- "Setup commandbuffers", "Draw commandbuffers", "pre/post-draw commandbuffers"

    -- Commandbuffer building. (CBs can be viewed as functions).

    -- Resource transformations.

    -- Concurrency/Parallelism for building commandbuffers.

    -- Communication with the GPU

    -- Commandbuffer submission. Mention out-of-order execution. Analogous to CPU instruction dispatch.
