Master's Thesis

Sources for my master's thesis document in the course of studies Computer Science and Media.

It's about the evaluation of resource management possibilities using the Vulkan graphics API.


Build
=====

Building the PDF requires a Windows operating system and MiKTeX installed and added to the `PATH` environment variable.

_Note: Other operating systems and LaTeX build options might work but are **untested**!_


Using the Script
----------------

The easiest way to build is to use the script `Utilities/Build.bat`. Just run it from anywhere and find the build result as `Source/Main.pdf`.


Using Sublime Text 3 and LaTeXTools
-----------------------------------

This is the preferred way to build. In addition to what is stated above, this method requires you to have Sublime Text 3 and the LaTeXTools package installed.

In order to build, just open the sublime project, make sure to have the LaTeXTools package installed and hit `Ctrl+B` to build. The resulting PDF can be found as `Source/Main.pdf`.
